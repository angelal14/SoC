Summer of Code 2020
Project 1: Opus Mania


### **How to run my code**
Run game.py. I have uploaded the Sprite images used in this program under the "testing" files... I accidentally created too many sub folders. But you can find the images under the folder named Testing2. Make sure you have the library arcade installed.
